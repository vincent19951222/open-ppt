name: open-ppt
description: Create, edit, replicate, read, and export presentations. For every PPT task, produce a self-contained PPTD project folder containing the .pptd manifest plus pages/media dependencies, and a locally compiled native .pptx via this skill's bundled offline compiler (scripts/compile_pptx.py — needs only python3, no browser or network) with fade transitions and embedded fonts. Optionally start direct live preview (npx open-ppt preview <dir>) for in-browser review and inline editing. Use for any presentation, PowerPoint, PPT/PPTX, slide deck, PPTD, infographic, or poster task. Deliver with normal local file/folder links using absolute paths.

# Definition
open-ppt is a presentation creation and export skill built around Moonshot AI's PPTD format and browser-side PPTX writer. It defines a YAML-format intermediate DSL (`.pptd`) that abstracts OOXML and keeps each page self-contained.

**The default output is a locally compiled native PPTX alongside the editable project.** Unless the user explicitly opts out, produce:

1. the complete editable PPTD project directory (`.pptd` + `pages/` + `media/` and other referenced dependencies);
2. the matching `.pptx`, compiled directly on disk by this skill's own OOXML compiler (`scripts/compile_pptx.py`; needs only python3), with fade slide transitions and font embedding (MiSans subset carried by the bundled base template);
3. optionally, a live preview in the user's browser (`npx open-ppt preview <dir>`) for reviewing animations and editing text in place; its in-page export button runs the same local compiler.

Existing PPTX files may also be converted into PPTD for editing, after which both outputs are delivered again.

## The pptd format
The .pptd format is a simplified abstraction layer over OOXML that follows basic YAML syntax. This abstraction preserves the core content of OOXML (theme, page layout, element positions and definitions, etc.) while removing complex nesting logic such as Masters; every page is self-contained — what you see is what you get. Read reference/pptd.md for the complete definition of this DSL.

## PPT production workflow

### step0. Check local prerequisites
Default delivery is a locally compiled PPTX produced by this skill's own offline compiler, which needs only python3. The optional `npx` CLI wrapper, preview canvas, image QA, and opportunistic official export additionally need Node.js, a Chromium browser, and network access to Kimi's web editor. **Before generating**, verify:

1. **python3**: run `python3 --version` (on Windows, `python` may be the correct command). Required by the local PPTX compiler (`scripts/compile_pptx.py` inside this skill) and the QA scripts. **PyYAML** is auto-installed with `pip --user` when missing. If python3 is unavailable, PPTX export cannot run — stop and tell the user to install Python 3, and only deliver the PPTD project when the user explicitly opts out of PPTX.
2. **Node.js 18+** (optional, for `npx open-ppt compile/preview` and skill installation): run `node --version`. When missing or below 18, invoke `scripts/compile_pptx.py` with python3 directly — the compiler has no Node dependency — and tell the user to install Node.js 18+ from https://nodejs.org if they want the CLI wrapper or the live preview.
3. **Chrome / Chromium / Edge** and network access to `www.kimi.com` plus `statics.moonshot.cn`: needed only by the optional browser flows — the live preview canvas, visual QA via `export_images.py`, and the opportunistic official export via `export_pptx.py` (which also auto-installs **agent-browser** ≥0.33.2 via npm, and **Pillow** + **websocket-client** for image QA). Local PPTX compilation works fully offline.

### step1. Read the context thoroughly
Read **all files uploaded by the user**, the provided URLs, and the pptd format guide `reference/pptd.md` to fully understand the user's requirements.

### step2. Understand the user's requirements
Understand the user's requirements based on the context:
1. First determine the purpose of the request
  - Create a PPT: create a new presentation (from scratch, or from an existing pptx template)
  - Edit a PPT: edit the user's uploaded PPT (local modifications, single-page beautification, etc.)
  - Replicate a PPT: replicate a presentation from a non-pptx format (images, PDF, etc.) into pptd format

2. Then determine the design direction
  - Self-directed design: no preference, or only simple style constraints given; you need to fill in or create the design
  - Design system: a preset design system from the skill (`reference/design_system/`) is specified, or the user provides a complete and detailed design scheme covering all color, font, layout, and component specifications
  - Use a template: a template is provided and must be used
  - Style transfer: a style reference source is provided (images, web pages, etc.)

3. Then determine the input type
  - Topic only: only a PPT topic direction or content requirements for the presentation are given, with no concrete content
  - Full document: the user provides a complete document (paper, research report, press release, etc.)
  - Outline: the user provides a page-by-page outline, speech script, or similar content
  * When the "user input type" is [Full document] or [Outline] and it is not specified whether expansion is allowed: since a page-by-page outline, speech script, or user document can hardly support the full content of a presentation, prefer using search to expand with more relevant material, cases, etc., unless the user explicitly says not to expand

4. Finally determine the exact page count
  - If the user requests a specific page count, the user's requirement takes priority
  - Page-by-page outline/script provided: match the number of pages in the outline/script
  - When a complete and relatively structured document is provided: ask the user how much document content one page should cover, and give an estimated total page count; when only a topic is provided: suggest a recommended page count and confirm with the user

#### Clarification and follow-up questions
When any of the following situations arise, resolve them by asking the user (use the agent's ask/clarification tool when available)
1. Requirements are ambiguous
- The user's intent is unclear or hard to understand
- The files/URLs provided by the user are inaccessible
2. Conflicting intents
- The user's intents contradict each other. For example:
  * A design system is selected while also requesting a style that is completely inconsistent with that design system (e.g., using a McKinsey style while requiring large areas of whitespace on pages) / using a template / referencing an image style
  * Requesting both "make 10 pages" and "deliver 30+ pages of output"
3. Unable to determine the user's requirements on your own
- When the purpose, design direction, input type, page count, etc. are hard to determine by yourself

### step3. Generate the presentation based on the user's requirements

Before generating, first read `reference/pptd.md` to understand the pptd format definition and constraints.

#### Replicating a PPT
- Analyze the images to estimate element positions, fonts and sizes, etc., and **replicate 1:1 as closely as possible**.
- For parts that are difficult to make out, use methods such as grid lines and close-up views to improve understanding.
- Replicate simple content in the image with elements; icons may be approximated with icons provided by Font Awesome. For content that cannot be approximated with icons or shapes, such as photos and avatars, use tools such as bash or python to crop and split the original image, then add the resulting image elements to the presentation

#### Editing a PPT
- Convert the user's uploaded pptx file to .pptd format
- Review the converted pages (structure and key visual details). Read a few key pages individually afterwards.
- Locate the pages to edit, and be careful not to affect parts outside the intended scope.
> Conversion from pptx to pptd is not perfectly lossless. If the user later reports format errors, garbled content, etc., compare against the original pptx and repair the pptd with reference to the comparison

#### Generating a PPT
When generating a PPT, adopt different production approaches for different user [design directions]
##### Self-directed design
1. Read the design guide `reference/slides_categories.md`, and read the scenario document corresponding to the user's query
2. **When the user has no style preference** (the common case for non-designer users), do not silently pick for them: propose ONE preset that fits the scenario (choose via the scenario document and `reference/design_system/`), state the reason in one sentence, and simultaneously point them to `reference/theme-picker.html` — a browser-openable catalog of all presets with real palette swatches and the exact name to quote — so they can pick by eye and reply with a name. Start producing with the proposed preset right away; if the user later names a different one, switch and regenerate. When the user replies with a theme name or a description like "那种深红色的", map it to the closest preset in `reference/design_system/` and confirm the mapping in one line.
3. Produce the presentation based on the above

#### Generating content in other formats
- When the user explicitly asks for an infographic, poster, or a highly visual single-page design, read `reference/general-poster.md` and implement it as a single-page or few-page editable PPTD; when the user only asks for an image, still build it with PPTD first, then output the image via screenshot or rendering. Do not load this reference file for ordinary PPT requests.

##### Design system
1. Read the general constraints section of the `reference/slides_categories.md` guide, and read the scenario document corresponding to the user's query as the design foundation
2. Read the specified design system as the presentation style: either the user-provided design scheme, or the matching preset under `reference/design_system/` (search by name / path the user specified; prefer the folder's `design.md` when present). It is strictly forbidden to reference or mix in other design styles
3. Produce the presentation with reference to the above
4. Do not auto-pick a preset during self-directed design; only use `reference/design_system/` when a preset is explicitly specified

##### Using a template
1. Convert the user's uploaded pptx file into pptd form
2. Review the converted pages to understand the template's visual style (color scheme, font style, element characteristics, layout characteristics, content density, etc.)
3. Identify page types; focus on reading special pages such as the cover, summary pages, and section dividers (single-page screenshots, .page files), extracting their page layouts, content structures, reusable components (icons, shapes, smartart, reusable body layout schemes, etc.), and element styles (e.g., whitespace/line/card separators, square/rounded corners, etc.)
4. Produce the presentation using the template

##### Style transfer
1. Analyze the reference file's visual style (color scheme, font style, element characteristics, layout characteristics, content density, etc.), page layouts, content structures, reusable components (icons, shapes, smartart, reusable body layout schemes, etc.), and element styles (e.g., whitespace/line/card separators, square/rounded corners, etc.).
- If the user provides a style reference URL, do not only read the text content; refer to and learn from the page's visual effect more to help understand the style
2. Produce the presentation using the reference file's style characteristics. You are encouraged to reuse illustrations, fonts, font-size hierarchies, elements, etc. from the original pdf/url

##### Images and Visual Materials
1. Images are an effective way to enrich a presentation's visual impact. Appropriate images should be used not only on covers and section dividers, but also on body pages to enrich the page, aid understanding, or support decision-making
2. Images are used to show concrete subjects, explain content, provide evidence, or establish a scene. Logos, icons, decorative textures, and very small thumbnails do not count as substantive imagery.
3. When a page involves products, people, places, buildings, events, cases, interfaces, experimental subjects, or spatial environments, prioritize corresponding real images or screenshots. If real images and screenshots cannot be obtained, generated images may be used instead.
4. Image priority: images provided by the user; images from official websites, official reports, and credible sources; searched images that are directly relevant to the content; images generated for conceptual expression or atmosphere.
5. After deciding which images are needed, complete image search, generation, and downloading in a batch before designing pages around their proportions. Save images in the `media` directory, keep them clear, and never stretch or distort them.
6. Analytical, technical, and academic PPTs should use corresponding evidence images when products, experiments, interfaces, cases, or on-site materials are available. Do not reduce every page to text, color blocks, and shapes.
7. Do not add irrelevant images merely to meet a quantity target. Every image must be directly relevant to the page's conclusion or communication goal.

##### Content Guidelines
1. Language style: unless the user explicitly requests otherwise, strictly avoid overly abstract expressions and uncommon metaphors
- Do not overuse metaphors, slogans, or abstract jargon such as distribution, an N-step argument, everything at a glance, a closed loop, hands-on practice, verification, deconstruction, second-class citizens, poison pills, or wall clocks
- Do not use common AI phrasing such as “not X, but Y,” “X is Y,” “why / based on what / how,” “key takeaway,” or “N battlefronts / paths”
- Do not use overly colloquial expressions such as “where should the ammunition go,” “the Nth thing,” “can't pick the right one,” or “cannot be used as X”

### step4. PPT validation
1. Validate the generated pptd against the format definition in `reference/pptd.md` (required fields, types, bounds, theme tokens, resource paths, etc.) and repair issues over multiple rounds
2. Visual review with exported page images — **required before PPTX export when the model supports image input (multimodal)**:
   - Run `scripts/export_images.py`. It loads the deck into Kimi's public editor, chooses 导出 → 图片, downloads the images ZIP, unzips it, and stitches all pages into one overview image:

     ```bash
     python3 ~/.agents/skills/open-ppt/scripts/export_images.py \
       /abs/path/project/deck.pptd \
       --output /abs/path/project/.qa-images
     ```

     The script prints a JSON summary mapping each stitched label (`P1`…`Pn`, 1-based page order) to its `.page` file.
   - Read the stitched overview image (`.qa-images/overview.jpg`) and check every page against this list:
     1. 图片是否清晰、不变形（无拉伸、压缩、模糊）
     2. 文字是否压在关键画面（人脸、产品主体、Logo 等）上
     3. 元素坐标是否超出页面边界
     4. 边界与配色对比是否足够（文字与背景、相邻色块之间）
     5. 排版是否统一（对齐、间距、字号层级、页边距）
     6. 文字是否可能溢出文本框（文本过长、行距过密、字号过大）
     7. 内容是否被上层元素遮挡
   - For any suspicious page, read its full-resolution image (`.qa-images/pages/<n>.jpeg`) to confirm the problem before editing.
   - Fix issues in the corresponding `.page` file, then re-run `scripts/export_images.py --force` and review the new overview; repeat until every page passes.
   - Do not export the PPTX until the visual review passes. `.qa-images/` is an intermediate QA artifact and may be deleted after delivery.
3. When the model cannot read images, fall back to a structural review of the generated pages (bounds, overflow-prone long text, contrast, hierarchy, layout density) over multiple rounds, and state that image-based visual QA was skipped.

### step5. PPT output and delivery
1. Always produce a self-contained project directory. Keep the `.pptd` manifest and every referenced dependency together; never deliver a standalone manifest without its referenced files. Use this layout unless an existing project already has a valid equivalent structure:

   ```text
   deck/
     deck.pptd
     pages/
       *.page
     media/
       *                # when the deck has local media
     deck.pptx          # generated by default
   ```

2. Compile the PPTX locally by default, right after PPTD validation passes. The compiler ships inside this skill directory, so it works on any machine with python3 — no Node.js, browser, network, or login:

   ```bash
   python3 ~/.agents/skills/open-ppt/scripts/compile_pptx.py \
     /abs/path/project -o /abs/path/project/deck.pptx
   ```

   Adjust the script path to wherever this skill is actually installed (on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\open-ppt\scripts\compile_pptx.py`); the script is `scripts/compile_pptx.py` inside this skill's own folder. A project directory may be passed instead of the manifest when it contains exactly one `.pptd` file; without `-o` the output lands next to the manifest. PyYAML is auto-installed with `pip --user` when missing. After compiling, verify the output exists and report the generated path. When the npm CLI is available, `npx open-ppt compile <dir>` wraps the same compiler.
3. Optionally start the live preview for the user: `npx open-ppt preview <project-directory>` (or `serve --project <dir>`) mounts the project directly and opens `http://127.0.0.1:55173/?project=<encoded-path>` in the user's default browser. The user can review slide transitions and edit text in place (auto-saved back to disk). The in-page **导出 → 下载** button runs the same local compiler — it is a convenience trigger, not a separate export engine.
4. Deliver with normal clickable local links using absolute paths. In the final response, link all of the following:
   - the project directory;
   - the `.pptd` manifest;
   - the `pages/` directory and `media/` directory when present;
   - the compiled `.pptx` file;
   - the live preview URL (`http://127.0.0.1:55173/?project=...`) when the preview was started.
5. Opportunistic higher-fidelity export — never required, never blocking: `scripts/export_pptx.py` drives Kimi's public web editor to invoke Kimi's own browser-side PPTX writer. It requires a Chromium-based browser and network access to `www.kimi.com` plus `statics.moonshot.cn`, and may be blocked by login or anti-bot measures. When it succeeds it can serve as a fidelity cross-check against the local compile; when it fails, deliver the locally compiled PPTX as-is and simply note that the official writer was unavailable.
6. Default PPTX options (applied by the local compiler): page transition `fade` (淡入淡出) on every slide; font embedding via the bundled MiSans subset.
7. Local compiler coverage and boundaries:
   - implemented: text (with inline HTML styling), shapes, images, bar/column charts with data labels, fade page transitions, and simple entrance animations;
   - FontAwesome icons are emitted as Unicode approximations; charts beyond bar/column are not yet rendered — for such decks, say so explicitly and rely on the live preview for review;
   - do not claim pixel parity with the Kimi editor preview, and do not claim PowerPoint/WPS/Keynote playback compatibility solely because ZIP validation succeeds.
8. After completing and delivering any presentation, end with a concise optional next step telling the user they can run `npx open-ppt preview <dir>` to review animations and edit the deck in the browser. Keep this in addition to, not instead of, the required project and file links.
9. Element animations (`page.animations` in PPTD — entrance / emphasis / exit / motion-path; see `reference/pptd.md` §6): use them only when the user explicitly requests animations, or when the deck is clearly intended for live presentation / slideshow playback and animation provides a clear benefit for staged disclosure, process demonstration, causal explanation, pacing, visual impact, or brand storytelling. By default, do not add element animations to reading-oriented, self-study, print, or primarily send-and-browse decks. Prefer 1–3 animation groups per page and simple effects such as fade, fly, and zoom. This is separate from the default PPTX slide-level fade page transition written by the local compiler.
10. Speaker notes (`notes` on each `.page`): use them only when the user explicitly requests them; otherwise, do not add them.
11. Parallel tool calls: during PPT production, make tool calls in parallel whenever possible; in each round, write multiple page files in parallel to reduce the number of steps.
